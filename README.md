![Discord Shield](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/[SERVER ID]/widget.png?style=shield)

Event Driven Development is a Approach that produce Events on Source-Code changes.

Events will be synced in Real-Time - No Commits - No Push.

Events will trigger Reactions that will publish other Events.

Key Aspects:

- Real-Time Sync of Events
- Full Traceability of Events
- Every Action in the Source-Code Development Process is an Event
- Every Action in the Source-Code Interaction Process is an Event
